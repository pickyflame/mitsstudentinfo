# 🎓 MITS Student Details Portal

A simple and responsive web application designed to display student details such as name, branch, phone number, and email ID. This portal is tailored for use at **Madhav Institute of Technology and Science (MITS), Gwalior**, to help manage and access student records efficiently.

## 📌 Description

The MITS Student Details Portal provides a clean, browser-based solution for viewing student information. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the portal requires no server or database—student data can be stored locally in a CSV or JSON file and displayed directly on the webpage.
